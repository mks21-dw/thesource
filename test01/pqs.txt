Question 11:

Programming question: 
Heron of Alexandria, a Greek mathematician and engineer, developed a method to approximate the square root of a number x using an iterative sequence. The method works as follows:

- A guess is made of the square root of x.
- If |guess^2 - x| < 0.000001, then the guess is accurate and is used as the output.
- Otherwise, a new guess is made by taking the average of the previous guess and x divided by that guess. This new guess replaces the original guess.

The process is repeated continuously until an accurate guess is obtained.

Using Racket syntax, write a function with inputs x and guess that approximates the square root of x using this method. You may assume that x and guess are both nonnegative numbers.

Include a contract and effective test cases for your function. It is not necessary to include the results of your test cases (the solution does this for completion).
