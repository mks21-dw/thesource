;Options:
;A: crt is only observer command while cro can be used in turtle context.
;B: You can put turtle specific commands, in [], following cro but not following crt 
;C:Crt assigns random headings and random pcolor, while Cro assigns evenly spaced
; headings, from 0-360, and pcolor based on who value
;D:Cro assigns random headings and random pcolor, while Crt assigns evenly spaced
; headings, from 0-360, and pcolor based on who value

Question 15:

;MC Question:
;It is the next morning. Seeing that you're here, the velociraptors still haven't got you yet.
;You have just received word from the other turtles that the velociraptors have begun using patches as hoverboards to make them run much faster.
;This is an issue.
;However, in the same report, the turtles have found previously unknown information about velociraptors, after having taken one hostage.
;
;This is one of the few procedures the velociraptor released in exchange for freedom: ;He also has been forced to go vegetarian for the rest of his life.
;to find-turtles
;  if (pcolor = red) [ fd 8 ]
;  ifelse (count other (velociraptors in-radius 3) < 10) and (time = 0)
;    [ die ]
;    [ set time-without-friends 20 ]
;  ifelse (count other (turtles in-cone 3 5) >= 2)
;    [ 
;      fd 2 
;      set time-without-friends time-without-friends - 1
;    ]
;    [rt 5]
;end
;
;What of the following do we learn about velociraptors from this procedure?
;I)   Velociraptors have mastered the art of using red turtles as hovercrafts to propel them forwards by 8 patches.
;II)  Velociraptors like being in groups and will die of loneliness if there are fewer than 10 other velociraptors around them for a given period of time.
;III) Velociraptors have very narrow lines of sight when finding turtles, but will move towards them if there are more than 2 sighted.
