Question 7:

MC Question:
A student creates a Racket function that takes two inputs, and uses a nested if structure to output a return value. The function returns a value using the process below.

1. The function first checks whether the two inputs are equal.
2. If the inputs are not equal, it checks whether the first input is a number and the second input is a Boolean value.
3. If neither of the two conditions in step 2 are true, it returns 0.

Which of these statements most accurately describes how Racket evaluates this function?
Skills: 2 and 6
Options:
A) Racket evaluates all conditions before returning a value.
B) Racket performs the equality test first, and only if it is false does it perform the test in step 2.
C) Racket performs the test in step 2 first, since it is more specific.
D) Racket returns 0 if either of the two inputs are not numbers.

Question 16:

MC Question: what's the difference between build-list and cons?
Skill: 2, 10
Options:
a cons takes integer n and a function f and constructs a list by calling f from 0 to the integer, and build-list builds a list node with a value of b and c.
b build-list builds on an existing, non-empty list and cons constructs a recursive function.
c cons involves robbing the Louvre and build-list creates your grocery store list for you.
d build-list takes integer n and a function f and builds a list by calling f from 0 to the integer, and cons constructs a list node with a value of b and c.
