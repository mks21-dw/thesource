Question 5.a:
;MC Question:
;Skills: 8 and 21
;A student wants to simulate a NetLogo model representing the reproduction of a new turtle from a parent turtle. In
;a regular birth, a new turtle preserves the parent color of the original turtle. However, the student wants to 
;simulate a randomized mutation in the turtle's color, where the turtle inherits the parent color but has a 
;mutation from -5 to 5, inclusive. The student's attempt in simulating this model is shown below.
;
;to mutation
; ask turtles [
;   hatch 1 [
;     set color ______________
;   ]
; ]
;
;Which of these lines of code completes the procedure and accurately represents the student's model?
;Options:
;A) [color] of parent + ((random 11) - 5)
;B) [color] of parent + (5 - (random 10))

;Consider the NetLogo wiggle procedure shown below, which facilitates the random movement of a turtle.
;
;to wiggle 
;  ask turtles [
;    rt random 30
;    lt random 30
;    fd 1
;  ]
;
;Three students make the following statements about this procedure. Which of the statements, if any, are correct?
;
;I. Though the turtle turns right and turns left by random amounts, the largest possible net turn in either direction
;is less than 30 degrees.
;
;II. Replacing the two separate right and left turns with the command rt (random 30 - random 30) would alter the 
;probabilities of some net turning angles, even though the range of all possible angles remains the same.
;
;III. Because the right and the left turns are executed in sequential order, the turtle's final heading is dependent
;on the order of the two commands in the procedure.
;Options:
;A) none of I, II, or III
;B) I, only
;C) II and III, only
;D) I, II, and III

Question 15.a:
;MC Question:
;You are a turtle wiggling around in a large, seemingly infinite land of multicolor squares. You are not the only breed here, though.
;You are very fearful of the velociraptor breed: You may not have ever seen them, but you are very afraid of them for one reason:
;They are very interested in eating you, and you would not like to be turned into turtle noodles.
;Luckily, the Observer above has provided you with powerful procedures that protect you from the velociraptors.
;
;One of the most important procedures that the Observer has taught you is the wiggle function, whose code is shown below:
;to wiggle
;    fd (random 6) + 1
;    rt random 180
;    lt random 180
;    wait random 3
;end
;
;One day, while you are looking for grass to eat, the Observer sees that you are in danger, and recommends that you take action by wiggling. What of the following should you do? 
;Note that the final answer might not be everything you should do, but what is listed is in order.
;I)   Rotate right by 180 degrees. ;If you look away from the velociraptors, they won't be there anymore.
;II)  Run forward the length of up to 6 of those squares. You'll decide by rolling a die.
;III) Stop for 1 or 2 seconds, or maybe just keep going. ;Not only should you look unpredictable, but you need to buy time to think.
;IV)  Rotate left by some number of degrees between 0 and 179. This one you'll decide by finding where the wind blows.
;Skill: 8 19
;Options:
;A) III, then IV, then I, then II.
;B) II, then I, then IV, then III.
;C) II, then IV, then III.
;D) I, then I, then I... ;Spinning in circles will only make you dizzy.
;
;Answer: C
;
=======================
Question 15.b:

;MC Question:
;With the help of the Observer, you have successfully escaped the velociraptors this time. 
;However, as the Observer goes to sleep for the night, you are left on your own to look out for velociraptors, as they will not sleep until they eat, and they are still very hungry. 
;Of course, with the lack of the Observer's careful gaze, you are reliant on the other turtles to protect you, and you all have agreed to protect each other.
;
;One of the procedures, perfected over generations of elder turtles, that you continually use nightly for this, is shown below:
;to look-out [radius]
;  ask other turtles (in-cone radius 90) [
;      if ((count velociraptors in-radius radius with [state = "starving"]) > 0)[
;          look-out radius
;          wiggle
;      ]
;  ]
;end
;
;Part of this procedure asks other turtles in your area to do something for you. What do these other turtles do?
;Skill:
;Options: 6 19 21 22
;A) Ask each turtle in a 90 degree cone with given radius from themselves to check for starving velociraptors around them, and look-out themselves and wiggle if there are.
;B) Check if there are velociraptors within radius of the turtle, then look-out themselves if there are and wiggle away.
;C) Ask each velociraptor in a 90 degree cone with given radius from the turtle to check for starving turtles around them, and look-out themselves and wiggle if there are.
;D) Check if there are velociraptors within radius of the turtle that are starving, then they should look-out and wiggle if there are.
