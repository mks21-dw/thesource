Question 31:

Programming Question
Skills: 1 2 3 5
Given the following description, write a function (or functions), as well as contracts and test cases for your function(s).

This function returns True if a given grade is above a given cutoff grade after curving using the following method:
    The square root method consists of multiplying 10 times the square root of a given grade.
        For example, curving a grade of 64 this way would return 80.
    Both the given and cutoff grades should be positive numbers from 0 to 100.
Examples:
    An initial grade of 64 with a cutoff of 70 would return True to symbolize a pass.
    However, an initial grade of 36 with the same cutoff of 70 would return False to symbolize a fail.

Example Solution:

; (curveGrade grade) -> positive number from 0 to 100
;    grade: positive number from 0 to 100
;    Given a grade, returns 10 times the square root of the grade.
;    (curveGrade 64) -> 80
(define curveGrade (lambda grade)(
                                  * 10 (sqrt grade)
                                 )
)
(display "curveGrade tests: (curveGrade 64) should return 80:")
(curveGrade 64)
(display "curveGrade tests: (curveGrade 36) should return 60:")
(curveGrade 36)

; (checkPass grade cutoff) -> boolean
;    grade, cutoff: positive numbers from 0-100
;    Given a grade, returns True if the curved grade is higher than a given cutoff grade, else returns False.
;    (checkPass 64 70) -> #true
;    (checkPass 36 70) -> #false
(define checkPass (lambda (grade cutoff) (
                                          > (curveGrade grade) cutoff
                                         )
